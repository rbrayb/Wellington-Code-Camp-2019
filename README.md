## Babbage and Lovelace - the dawn of computing

Presented to Wellington Code Camp 2019.

Charles Babbage was an English polymath who designed an "Analytical Engine" in the 1840's. He believed that this machine
could do fully-fledged general purpose computation. 

Ada Lovelace helped him document the workings but quickly came to realise the implications of this design. She realised 
that anything that could be represented symbolically; numbers, logic, even music could pass through the machine and create 
"magic".

The "Analytical Engine" represents the dawn of the computer age. To demonstrate its working, Ada wrote mathematical proofs
that many people believe are the first computer programs.

This is their story.
